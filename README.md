This is a simple app developing/developed for learning/demonstrating rails best practices.
As a beginning, I am interested to have a look over different object patterns.
This app contain 

### Query Object Pattern

At some moment, our controller might have became too fat and hence will be very difficult to manage it. Eg when we need to filter out data based on some queries and it might grow in future as well.
So in this kind of situation actually we can think of following Query object pattern such that out query logic all will goto another class file and hence our controller will look neater

### Service Object Pattern
Coming up shortly. 
   
##### Note:
This app is purely for learning/practice purpose. Can be buggy as well since I was interested only on the core concepts.
